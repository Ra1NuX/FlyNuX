This is a proyect created with Vite and ReactJS. 

# Instalation Guide

Clone this repo and use `npm i` to install the dependencies. 

When all dependendies are installed use the command `npm run dev` to start in development mode.

I use Vite instaed of npx create-react-app because vite its more efficent and fast to compile.
